# Disentangling-Outbreak-Patterns-of-Dengue-Fever-in-Nepal-A-District-Level-Analysis-from-2006-to-2022

##This repository contains the code and resources used for analyzing and modeling dengue fever outbreak patterns across 77 districts of Nepal from 2006 to 2022. This project aims to disentangle and understand the contributions of multiple dengue outbreaks at the district level, using statistical models to estimate the timing and scale parameters of the outbreak intensity functions. 

Please note that the manuscript associated with this code and code are yet to be peer-reviewed.
